```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Overview
Today we will focus on **R Functions** but we will start with **file reading**
```

plot(1:10, type="l", col="blue")

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#Test1
```
read.table("test1.txt", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#Test2
```
read.table("test2.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "$")

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#Test3
```
read.table("test3.txt", header = FALSE)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#MY FIRST FUNCTION
```
add = function(x, y=1) {x + y}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
```
add(4, y=5)


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
```
rescale = function(x) {
rng = range(x)
(x-rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])}


rescale(1:10)
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
```
x = c(1,3,NA,5,10)
rng = range(x, na.rm=TRUE)
rng
x(-rng[1]) / (rng[2]-rng[1])
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
