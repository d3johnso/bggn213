## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
read.delim("mm-second.x.zebrafish.tsv")
```

```{r}
b <- read.delim("mm-second.x.zebrafish.tsv",)
colnames(b) <-  c("qseqid", "sseqid", "pident", "length", "mismatch", "gapopen", "qstart", "qend", "sstart", "send", "evalue", "bitscore")
```

```{r}
## Asuming your blast results are stored in an object called 'b'
plot(b$pident  * (b$qend - b$qstart), b$bitscore)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(b, aes(pident, bitscore)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) 

```
